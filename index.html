        <ol> <h2>Instruction:</h2>
            <li>Heat a saucepan. Keep the heat to a low and add the butter.</li>
            <li>When the butter melts and starts to bubble, then add 1 tablespoon whole wheat flour or 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour.</li>
            <li>Using a wired whisk stir the flour quickly as soon as you add it. Keep on stirring so that no lumps are formed.</li>
            <li>The frequent stirring helps the flour to cook evenly. You will see the flour frothing and bubbling up while stirring.</li>
            <li>Keep the heat to the lowest and then pour the cold or chilled milk in a gentle stream. Pour the milk with one hand and stir the sauce mixture with the other.</li>
            <li>The milk has to be chilled, so that lumps are not formed. If you use hot or warm milk or milk at room temperature, lumps can be formed.</li>
            <li>Do stir frequently while the milk warms and heats up.</li>
            <li>On a low heat, simmer the sauce till it thickens.</li>
            <li>When the sauce has thickened well and coats the back of a spoon, turn off the heat.</li>
            <li>Mix very well and set aside. Do note that on cooling white sauce will thicken more. So you can keep the consistency accordingly.</li></ol>
